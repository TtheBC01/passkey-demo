# Passkey demo in straight HTML

Playing around with the [Web Authentication API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Authentication_API). 

## Run locally:

```shell
docker run -it --rm --entrypoint bash -p 8000:8000 -v /path/to/passkey-demo/:/root/app python
cd /root/app
python -m http.server
```

## Iframe compatibility

By adding `allow="publickey-credentials-get *"` to an iframe element, you can request signatures from a passkey generated by a third party domain,
but you *cannot* request a new passkey be created by the third party domain inside the iframe.

```html
<iframe src="https://toddchapman.io/passkey-demo/" allow="publickey-credentials-get *" title="Passkey Demo">
</iframe>
```

## Other Notes:

Passkey are issued on a per eTLD+1 basis unless other options are specified by the client. That is, `abc.example.com`, `abc.example.com/resource`, and `def.myexample.com` all access the same passkey/public key credential under the [W3C](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/) standard. 

Most major implementations of the Web Authentication API auto increments a [counter](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#signature-counter) value every time `get` is 
invoked successfully. Hence, even you request a signature on the same challenge text, you will not receive the same signature value on successive invocations. 
For this reason WebAuthn is not appropriate for key-ratchet style algorithms for deriving new keys from message signing. 

The options for public key credential algorithms (`pubKeyCredParams`) are `-7` for Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm with SHA-256 and `-257` for RSA Signature with SHA-256.
